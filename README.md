# -Descriptive-Predictive-Analysis-with-Interactive-Dashboard

This project combines **exploratory data analysis** and **machine learning** into a fully interactive dashboard using **Python**, designed to deliver both **insights and forecasts** from a sales dataset.

# Project Overview
Goal:
Perform descriptive analytics (summary, insights, visualizations)
Build a predictive model (e.g., regression/classification)
Design an interactive dashboard to explore data & predictions

# Descriptive Analytics
- Total sales, average price, top categories/products
- Trends by time/category
- Interactive filters using Streamlit

# Predictive Analytics
- Machine Learning model (e.g., Linear Regression)
- Predict `Sales` or `Revenue` from input variables
- Trained model saved and reused for fast prediction

 # Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** for model building
- **Streamlit** for dashboard UI
